# CST MATLAB API

This API offers a multitude of code files that generate complex CST models. The code can be used to design desired shapes, set materials, frequency of operation, solver etc. Additionally you can call the specified solver and output the simulation results; all in within from MATLAB. 
To get started, open the MicrostripExample in the Examples folder where you'll find a step by step process in the comments on how to operate the code.
